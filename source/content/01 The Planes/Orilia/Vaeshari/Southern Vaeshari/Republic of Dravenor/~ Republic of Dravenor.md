> _"In Dravenor, everything has a price—goods, passage, protection."_  
> _— A common saying among the Merchant Guard_
## Overview
The Republic of Dravenor is not a kingdom of castles and crowns, but a sprawling, gritty network of formally independent city-states bound by trade. It exists as the vital, and only reliable, mercantile artery connecting the prosperous south of Vaeshari to the wild, unexplored north. Its wealth is built on tariffs, tolls, and the services that cater to the endless flow of travelers on the Meridian Road.

This wealth comes at a brutal cost. Dravenor is a land perpetually under soft siege. To the west, bandits and worse spill from the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]] of [[~ The Borderlands]]. To the east, strange things crawl from the depths of the [[Meridian Sea]]. The locals, hardened and cynical, view the constant stream of wealthy southern merchants and foolhardy northern adventurers with a mix of resentment and weary opportunism, leading to strictly segregated quarters in every city.

Currently, Dravenor is a republic in a fragile equilibrium. The Council of Mayors bickers over the division of trade revenues while scrambling to fund the beleaguered guards and private hunters who keep the monsters at bay, while maintaining a strong military to scare of a potential invasion from [[~ High Dominion Of Varkesh|~ High Dominion Of Varkesh]].

## Summary
## Geography
Dravenor is a rain-drenched coastal strip, perpetually caught between the fury of the Meridian Sea and the looming wall of the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]]. The entire nation exists on the **windward side** of the mountains, where prevailing eastward winds dump nearly constant moisture. There is no dry refuge within its borders; only varying degrees of saturation and storm exposure. Beyond the Storm-Fang Mountains lies the **rain shadow** of the leeward side, an arid badland called [[~ The Borderlands|~ The Borderlands]]. 
### Climate & Weather
Moisture evaporates from the [[Meridian Sea]] and is driven inland by prevailing winds. As this saturated air hits the impassable slopes of the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]], it has nowhere to go but up. It cools, condenses, and releases its burden as precipitation over all of Dravenor. The climate is one of frequent rain, rolling sea fogs, powerful gales, and sudden, violent squalls. Summers are cool and wet, winters are bitter and storm-wracked with occasional sea-snow. The air is always heavy with moisture, leading to rust, rot, dense forests, and churning mud.

### The Two Roads

- **The Meridian Road (The "Golden Road"):** Runs along the coast of Dravenor. Its dangers are maritime and meteorological: coastal monsters, thick fog, landslides, and large storm waves. Protection requires naval patrols, lighthouse networks, and hunters specializing in aquatic horrors.

- **The Mountain Path (The "Rim Run"):** Runs along the treacherous foothills of the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]]. Its dangers are terrestrial and human: mudslides, rockfalls, ambushes and raids by Borderland bandits descending from their dry homeland. Protection requires knowledge of the unstable terrain, fortifications at high passes, and mercenaries skilled in woodland combat.
## History
The history of Dravenor is a testament to grim pragmatism. It is not a tale of a chosen people conquering a fertile land, but of desperate castaways surviving a hostile one, only to discover their misery was their greatest asset. Its rise was impossible until the world had a reason to brave its storms.
### The "Drowning Years"
The first settlers were the discarded and the doomed: exiles, shipwrecked sailors, refugees and criminals fleeing mainland wars. They found the coast of Dravenor and its foothills to be a beautiful yet deadly trap. The constant rains and waterlogged soil made sustained agriculture difficult, limiting communities to fishing, foraging, and small, sodden garden plots. These isolated stockades, like [[Meridian Cross]] on its windy headland and [[Vance's Hold]] in a defensible cove, were less settlements and more permanent shelters. Leadership fell to those who could organize survival, the first Contract-Binders, establishing a tradition of rule by practical ability, not heredity.

### The Pathfinder's Accord (The Birth of Commerce)
For centuries, Dravenor remained a small, rain-swept backwater. Its change in fortune came from the north. Adventurers from [[~ Verdanthal]], returning south with trophies and tales of untamed riches, discovered that the only passable route that avoided endless leagues of swamp and sheer mountain was this very strip. Simultaneously, merchants from the prosperous [[~ Kingdom of Sunstone]] to the south realized the north held vast, untapped wealth. Suddenly, the miserable stockades of Dravenor found themselves as the indispensable choke point on a burgeoning trade route. The locals, experts in surviving the land's dangers, became invaluable as guides, porters, and protectors. In 234 AC, the elders of the five largest holds met at Meridian Cross. Understanding that infighting would destroy their newfound value, they forged the **Pathfinder's Accord**. This was not a patriotic constitution, but a business contract: it standardized tolls for the Meridian Road, created a shared bounty ledger for major threats, and formed the **Council of Mayors** to settle inter-city disputes. Dravenor's "government" was born as a joint trade commission.

### The Sundering and the Rise of the Borderlands
The Accord's mercantile focus was not for all. A faction from the tougher foothill settlements, led by the warrior **Kaelen the Grim**, saw the treaty as a sell-out. They prized strength and sovereignty over southern gold. Refusing to bend the knee to a council of toll-collectors, they rebelled. After a series of vicious skirmishes (the **Sundering**), Kaelen's followers were driven not out, but _up and over_ the Storm-Fang crests. On the leeward, rain-shadow side, they found a harsh, arid land that matched their temperament, the desolate reaches that would become the [[~ The Borderlands]]. From these dry bastions, their descendants now look upon Dravenor with enduring hatred and envy, their raids a perpetual drain on the republic's resources. The Sundering defined Dravenor's border and its eternal human adversary.

### The Guilded Age and Present Tensions
Fueled by the relentless flow of trade, Dravenor transformed. Stone replaced wood, and specialized **Guilds** (Cartographers, the League of Salvage and Bounty) arose, wielding power rivaling the mayors. The need for specialized monster-hunters formalized the freelance **Greycloaks**, who operate on contracts from cities, guilds, or desperate individuals. Today, Dravenor is wealthy but strained. Its original failing (poor agriculture) has become a permanent vulnerability, making it dependent on imported food and thus eternally invested in the security of trade. The Council is fractured by debates over who truly bears the burdens of defense. The wealth gap between merchant elites and the steadfast locals grows, and the monsters, far from being eradicated, seem to evolve with the rising bounties. Dravenor's history is a cycle: survival forged unity, unity unlocked wealth, wealth breeds internal strife, and strife invites the old dangers back in. The republic persists because the alternative would mean a return to the Drowning Years.
## Foreign Relations & Trade
Dravenor’s existence is predicated on being the indispensable middleman. Its foreign policy is not one of alliances or ideologies, but of calculated interdependence and enforced neutrality. The republic’s leadership understands that taking a side in the conflicts of greater powers would strangle the trade that is its lifeblood.

- **[[~ Kingdom of Sunstone]]:** Dravenor’s most vital relationship. Sunstone's merchants provide the flow of gold, finished goods, and, most critically, food. Dravenor, in return, offers secure passage and access to the exotic resources and treasures of the north. The relationship is symbiotic but lopsided; Sunstone could find other, harder routes, but Dravenor would starve without Sunstone's grain.
- **[[~ High Dominion Of Varkesh]]:** A relationship defined by mutual need and profound irritation. Varkesh covets the northern resources that flow through Dravenor and chafes at the heavy tariffs. They see Dravenor not as a nation, but as a gang of opportunistic bandits controlling a road they wish to own. Skirmishes at sea and proxy conflicts via Borderland raiders are common. Yet, open war has been avoided. It is rumored Varkesh wants to lay claim to Dravenor in order to monopolize the resources from the north in their efforts to dominate all of Vaeshari. 
- **[[~ The Borderlands]]:** More a condition than a diplomatic relationship. The descendants of Kaelen the Grim view the republic with bitter contempt. Trade with them is minimal, consisting of clandestine deals for information or the ransom of captured merchants. Their raids are treated not as acts of war by a state, but as a natural hazard to be managed via bounty postings and pre-emptive strikes by Greycloaks.
- [[~ Vaesharan Frontier|~ Vaesharan Frontier]]:** Dravenor has no formal government-to-government relations with the scattered northern realms. Its dealings are with adventuring companies, frontier outposts, and independent explorers. The republic sells them gear, maps, and safe harbor, and buys their plunder. This makes the north both a goldmine and a source of constant, unpredictable danger that often follows the adventurers back south.
## Governance & Law

Dravenor is governed by the **Pathfinder's Accord**, a living document less concerned with rights and more with regulating trade. It establishes a framework where commerce is the highest law.

- **The Council of Mayors:** The executive and judicial body. Each major city-state sends its elected or strongest-backed Mayor to the council chamber in [[01 The Planes/Orilia/Vaeshari/Southern Vaeshari/Territories/Vorynthian Confederacy/Towns & Cities/Brightwater|Brightwater]]. They vote on matters of collective defense, road maintenance, standardizing tolls, and adjudicating disputes between cities or major guilds. The High Speaker (currently Vorren Whitlock) chairs the meetings and breaks ties but holds no veto; true power lies in building coalitions around profitable compromises.
- **Guild Authority:** Powerful guilds (Cartographers, Salvage & Bounty, Merchant Guard) operate with significant autonomy. They set professional standards, control key knowledge, and maintain private security. Their agreements often carry the weight of law within their domains. Conflicts between guild jurisdiction and city authority are a constant source of tension.
- **Enforcement:** Law is kept by the City Watch (local peacekeepers), the Merchant Guard (road and caravan security), and the freelance Greycloaks (bounty hunters and monster slayers). Justice is typically swift, practical, and focuses on restitution (fines, property seizure) or removal (exile, outlawry) rather than incarceration.
## Religion & Beliefs
Dravenor has no state religion. Instead, two secular codes hold social and legal sway. **The Coin** represents the absolute primacy of contract, debt, and payment. A deal sworn upon the Coin is legally and socially binding. **The Compact** represents the mutual obligations required for survival in a hostile land: aiding against monsters, upholding the Accord, and not jeopardizing the trade route for short-term gain. Breaking the Compact is a crime punished by exile or being branded "Contractless," denying all protection and services.
## Defense & War Capabilities

Dravenor does not maintain a large, patriotic standing army. Its defense is a pragmatic, piecemeal system built to manage perpetual low-level threats and deter major powers, all funded directly by the trade it protects.

- **The Standing Forces:** The republic’s only permanent, centrally-funded military force is garrisoned at the strategic fortress of [[Vance's Hold]]. Numbering around 2,000 professional soldiers, marines, and artillery crews, they are well-drilled and equipped. Their primary role is to serve as a strategic reserve and a visible deterrent, particularly against aggression from Varkesh or a massed assault from the Borderlands. They are the shield that makes conquest seem too expensive.
- **The Mercenary Core:** The day-to-day defense of the roads and cities is outsourced. The Merchant Guard is the largest licensed mercenary company, holding contracts with the Council and major guilds to patrol the Meridian Road and Mountain Path. They are supplemented by smaller, specialized companies hired for specific threats or seasons. This system is flexible and ties defense costs directly to trade revenue, but it can lead to conflicts of interest and loyalty.
- **The Irregulars:** The first line of defense against non-human threats. **Greycloaks** are independent hunters who clear monster infestations for posted bounties. They are highly skilled but unpredictable. **Guild Loyalists** are the private enforcers of the major guilds, defending guildhalls, caravans, and assets. In a crisis, the Council can issue a “Compact Call,” nationalizing these forces temporarily, but compensation is expected.

Dravenor’s strategy is defensive economization. It avoids offensive wars, instead using its wealth to fortify chokepoints (lighthouses, pass-fortresses), fund privateers to harass rivals, and pay bribes to divert threats. Its key vulnerability is its reliance on imported food; a true naval blockade or the simultaneous severing of both roads would bring the republic to its knees within months. Its military exists to make that cost so high that no rival dares attempt it.
## Factions 

Power in Dravenor is not monolithic. It is a contested tapestry of competing interests, all operating under the brittle umbrella of the Accord. Survival requires cooperation, but wealth breeds competition, creating a landscape of entrenched factions.
### The Council of Mayors & The Accord Loyalists
- **Description:** The official government faction, but far from unified. Comprises the sitting Mayors, their appointed bureaucrats, and the wealthy merchants who directly benefit from the status quo of the Pathfinder's Accord. They believe in slow, pragmatic reform from within the system.
- **Goals:** Maintain the flow of trade at all costs, standardize and increase tariff efficiency, and present a united front to foreign powers like Varkesh. They seek to gradually bring the guilds and Greycloaks under greater Council oversight.
- **Internal Conflict:** Fractured between "Coastal" mayors (who prioritize naval defense and relations with Sunstone) and "Rim" mayors (who demand more resources for the Mountain Path and action against the Borderlands). High Speaker Whitlock constantly navigates this divide.
### The Guild Coalition
- **Description:** A loose but powerful alliance of the major professional guilds: the Cartographer's League (controls maps and navigation secrets), the League of Salvage and Bounty (official record-keepers for monster bounties and wreck claims), and the Merchant Guard Company (the largest mercenary provider). They represent institutionalized, specialized power.
- **Goals:** Protect guild autonomy and monopolies on key services. Oppose any Council efforts to cap fees or nationalize their functions. They seek to influence the Council by funding sympathetic mayors and controlling vital information.
- **Power Base:** Their power comes from control of expertise. No major caravan can move safely without their maps, their bounty certifications, or their guards.
### The Greycloaks
- **Description:** Not a formal organization, but a recognized class of freelance monster-hunters, trail-finders, and problem-solvers. Named for their weather-stained cloaks, they operate on a contract basis. They are revered by common folk and viewed as necessary nuisances by the authorities.
- **Goals:** Individual profit and professional reputation. They seek the highest bounties and the freedom to operate without excessive guild fees or Council regulation. Some dream of forming a formal charter to gain collective bargaining power.
- **Culture:** Deeply pragmatic, cynical, and bound by an informal code of "clan-kinship." They share information on threats, avenge fallen colleagues, and distrust outsiders who don't understand the true dangers of the land.
### The Cold Traders (The Borderland Remnants)
- **Description:** The descendants of Kaelen the Grim and those in Dravenor who secretly sympathize with their cause. They operate as a clandestine network within the republic's cities, particularly in the Rim settlements. They are a faction of blood, bitterness, and revanchism.
- **Goals:** The ultimate overthrow of the "merchant tyranny" of the Accord. In the short term, they work to destabilize Dravenor by sabotaging trade, smuggling weapons to Borderland raiders, and assassinating key Guild and Council figures.
- **Divisions:** Split between "Purists" who want to burn Dravenor and reclaim the coast for a warrior culture, and "Pragmatists" who believe they must first infiltrate and control the republic's wealth to fund their rebellion.
### The Cult of Coin 
- **Description:** A philosophical and increasingly religious movement that venerates **The Coin** not as a symbol, but as a literal divine principle of balance, contract, and cosmic transaction. It attracts merchants, lawyers, and those who have seen the absolute power of a fulfilled contract. A radical fringe within the cult sometimes mockingly called "The Invisible Hand" espouses a form of zealot-neo-mercantilism. They believe all value is personal, all exchange sacred, and that any outside intervention in a transaction is heresy. ("The Market Provides, The Market Demands.")
- **Goals:** To formalize their beliefs into an accepted religion, building shrines (often led by "Tellers" who interpret contract-law as scripture) and pushing for all of Dravenor’s laws to be explicitly framed as binding contracts with the state itself. The most extreme fringe dreams of a society where even justice, protection, and fresh water are purely private enterprises.
- **Influence:** Gaining popularity among the mercantile elite and ambitious guild factors. Their dogma threatens the more flexible, survival-based **Compact**, and their calls for "divine deregulation" are viewed with alarm by the Council.
### The Sog-bottom Syndicate
- **Description:** The criminal underbelly that thrives in the rain-slicked alleys of every port. A confederation of smugglers, thieves, pirates, and black-market brokers. They are the anti-guild, profiting from what the official structures forbid or tax too heavily.
- **Goals:** Control the flow of illicit goods (untaxed luxuries, banned magic, stolen relics), provide "alternative protection" for those who can't pay Guild rates, and corrupt officials to ensure a blind eye is turned.
- **Operations:** They are the primary purchasers of goods stolen by Borderland raiders, creating an underground economic link between Dravenor and its enemies. They constantly war with the Merchant Guard who take bounty contracts against them.
